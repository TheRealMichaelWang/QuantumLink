Running along the path at a decent clip, she smiled as she heard the catcalls from the University aged guys playing Frisbee in the park. Having parked up the road rather than in the parking lot she preferred to stretch and start her run well in advance so she had her momentum for moments like these. The sun was shining again after a week of on and off again rains and she could see the creek that ran through the park was finally starting to stay within it’s banks. Continuing past the playing fields she went into the trees onto the springy path, still humid and damp as it tried to dry out. As the trail went lower it became muddier and she smiled as she kept up her jog, slowing slightly to accommodate the slippery mud underfoot, her socks and lower legs now getting splattered and taking her back to her days on the cross country team, in particular the first day “the Hunger” took over during a rainy training run. Slowing down to a walk as she encountered a really black and grey pit where the water had only just receded she listened to the squelching and sucking of the mire at her feet with every step. Ignoring the sign saying that the path was closed due to flooding she carried on regardless.

Her shoes were white, now they were a dirty grey and they were wet. The dampness was soaking through her socks now as she sloshed through the puddles noting some interesting ruts in there as she went through, watching the waves from her footsteps in the couple of inches of water radiating out into the stream in a slow, steady rhythm as she stopped and the muddy water oozed around her. Stomping her feet and sending a spray of muddy water up her leg she watched the ripples again when the sound of a motor caught her attention. Not wanting to be seen here, she scanned the trail quickly and saw a mound in amoung the trees and she ran for it as the engine noise definitely got closer. Scrambling up the plastic she vaulted over the top and landed with a wet slap into a pile of gooey mud that easily wrapped around her ass and upper thighs and started to ooze into her shorts. She bit down on her lip to stop from squealing in disgust, and delight at it as she slowly lifted herself up against what she realized now was a muddy pile of sandbags as a couple of park patrol officers in waders drove ATVs along the path, slowing and looking around. Catching words like “reported someone heading this way” and “up ahead” before they rode off.

Looking down her hands were now covered in grey black silt as was the front of her top and her chin. The smell hit her next as she realized that this mud had been fermenting away for a few days now. As she realized that she also realized how hard her nipples were poking against her sports bra under her stained blue top. Plopping back down she grabbed a handful of the mud and squished it between her fingers savouring the texture of it. Almost slimy it was getting towards a dry clay consistency as she worked it between her fingers and rubbing her ass into it.

Sighing she stood up and made her way back around the pile this time, sliding ankle deep into the mud, her shoes and socks now completely enveloped with mud lubricating the inside of her runners. They were ruined if this scummy mud got inside so she went back for the trail and continued on her way exploring. Reaching a point where the trail was washed out she walked on confidently as she slowly went up to her waist, now completely soaked from the waist down, although she was working on that before she hit the water. Climbing out the other side, having to crawl out on her hands and knees she wiped her hands off in her hair, then scooped up some of the mud and did “war paint” designs on her face as she thought she might as well look like a feral girl, picking up a handful of vegetation and smearing that through her hair and rubbing it over her shirt. Trudging along through the ankle deep mud she started to climb again on the trail, a bit disappointed and also wondering where she might clean off since it was still early in the evening and the days were getting longer.

Spying a puddle of stagnant water she went and stood in it, mixing the water in to form a slurry and then sat down on it as she considered her next move, smoothing mud over her legs and making mud pies when she heard the engines again. Panicking slightly she stood up and ran towards a T intersection with the trail, really rutted with tire tracks and churned up. Scrambling up that way she found herself going upwards as the engines were getting closer. When she heard the voices from their radios as they stopped by the intersection she looked down and saw the ditch. Working her way down the mud and old leaf covered slope she crawled into a culvert and stayed there on her haunches in the black ooze that filled it as the ATVs went overhead.

Breathing hard, she realized what a workout she was giving herself rather than accepting a nice ride from the park police for being somewhere she shouldn’t. The oily muck on her really made her realize this was even older than the first muck she was in. Curious and already dirty she crawled her way along the culver to the other side and started to trudge through and over the rough green covered clumps of mud. Periodically her foot would break through the crust into something that reeked and was as black as used motor oil but she kept on until she heard voices. Movement in the corner of her eye on the far side of the trees caught her attention and she crouched low. Whoever it was, they were getting closer and she ran forward a bit, branches snapping before she tripped on a log and landed face first in a two inch deep pool of flood water and a few inches of slime. Hearing the voice call out and then hearing others she realized she was looking out at the far side of the playing field.

Burying herself in the squelching muck as much as she could, the smelly slime oozing between her breasts and into her shorts from the legs and the waist, she held her breath and buried herself up to her nose, keeping completely still as she saw some of the Frisbee players from earlier looking through the trees in her direction. After a few minutes they agreed they had just seen an animal, retrieved the Frisbee that had bounced off a tree and resumed their game right there. Snorting in the muck she guessed they were right, she was an animal. The thought of them all seeing her like this…as an animal made her spread her legs and start bucking her hips slowly as she laid in the filth. Studying their bodies and their movements she watched appreciatively, like a predator and just let herself imagine the indulgence of striding out, naked, covered in smelly filth and letting them do whatever they wanted with her. Sitting up she peeled herself out of her shirt and her sports bra, tossing them a bit ahead of her clear of the pit before laying back down and letting the oozing black slime envelop her tits. It felt so good against her nipples, the way it cupped her breasts and sucked at them as she moved. Dunking her head under she let herself become one with the mud puddle and continued to watch the young guys playing their game, some of the shirts having come off.

Sliding a hand down she undid the drawstring on her little shorts and then sat up, mud oozing off her tits as she pulled down her shorts and her panties as she let her imagination continue to dream up scenario after scenario of degradation with the 8 of them that she counted. Rubbing the muck against her pussy she reached back further to her as crack and back up again slowly when the Frisbee headed her way. Her heart was pounding and she froze, eyes wide, still fingering her clit as it flew over the nearest one’s head and bounced off a tree about 5 meters away from her. The nearest one turned and started to head her way and she really panicked this time. Flopping down she rolled over, mud flowing into her ass crack before she rolled back onto her front, closed her eyes, took a breath and tried to completely disappear in the muck. Surfacing a minute later she looked up to see him turning back laughing along with the others. In one hand she saw the Frisbee, in the other she saw her muddy top and sports bra.

Fuck! She realized, he was practically on top of her to have found those. Was her ass sticking out? Had he seen her? It was too much for her and she slid her hand down through the muck and started to masturbate furiously, burying her head when she came hard within seconds. She kept going through it, never having squirted that much or that hard on her own and having to bury her head in the slime to keep from crying out. Spent and feeling just disgusted, from the filth, from the thoughts and just from almost letting herself get caught. She was discrete, she was always in control and she wasn’t sure she liked almost losing that control in public. Sitting up and letting the mud ooze up between her legs before she slowly pulled her shorts and panties up she considered her options.

The sun was setting and the guys were leaving, having left her shirt and bra on the field, their jokes as exhausted as themselves. Listening for the engines or other people she darted out, grabbed the clothes and kept going across the narrowest open expanse, a black blob against the evening light. Reaching the trees on the other side, rough bark against her muddy breasts and hands, she panted for breath and slowly put her top back on after the bra. At least clothed, but in no way being able to explain the state she was in she kept to the trees until she reached a big puddle and jumped in, rubbing herself down in a crude bath. A few minutes later she heard the engines, she was still stained and smelly but more presentable, but it was getting dark. Running as fast as she could, sweating under the layer of muck still on her body she eventually reached her car, found where she hid the keys in a wheel well and grabbed her towels and started to scrape herself vigorously. She got in the car and drove off as she the lights from the ATVs came into view following the path she sprinted, towels on the seat and headrest taking the brunt of the mess. Driving into the night she vowed not to get that carried away again, at least in public, but deep down, the tingle between her legs told her she was glad to have the memories of this night. She couldn’t wait to think about them as she soaked in the bath, probably her favourite evening jog ever.
